A modification of the googlePlacesSearch plugin for SiriServerCore.

__

Installation:

1) This is a modification, so replace the googlePlacesSearch/__init__.py file (from https://github.com/jimmykane/SiriServerCorePlugins) with this __init__.py

1b) If using the JimmieKane server, you will want to change the name of my file to "googlePlacesSearch.py"

2) Currently only responds to "I'm Hungry"

3) To add new commands, (similar to smalltalk.py), copy/paste the code at the bottom (def search_im_hungry.....etc) to a new line

4) Change @register to have new keywords

5) Change name of def from search_im_hungry to whatever you want

6) Change Title = <what to search for>

Bugs?

Doesn't seem to want to work with the search query "cheap dinner". Seems to be a Google Places thing.
